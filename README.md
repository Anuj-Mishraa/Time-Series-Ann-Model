# Time-Series-Ann-Model
<p>
I have created two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series models for COVID-19 prediction and pollution forecasting. These models use historical data to predict future trends in these areas. The COVID-19 model can help health officials and policymakers to anticipate the spread of the virus and take necessary actions to control it. The pollution forecasting model can help to identify areas with high pollution levels and take measures to reduce the harmful effects on public health and the environment. These models are valuable tools for decision-making in public health and environmental management.
